### Presented by: Samuel Mbugua Igecha

## BUSINESS PROBLEM
SyriaTel are a telecommunications company based in the USA who are looking to better understand the reasons behind their customer churn so they formulate strategies to better counter it. Attracting new customers can be very expensive as seems that being proactive by retaining your customers is the key to effective churn management in a telecom company

## Objectives
1.To build machine learning models that will predict how likely a customer will churn.

2.To find the best machine learning model for the correct classification of churned/retained customers.

3.To determine which features affect the customer churn rate thereby giving necessary recommendations.

# Data Understanding

### Conclusion and recommendations


With this information, the telephone company can take steps to reduce churn and retain customers. For example, they could investigate whether their international plans are meeting the needs of their customers or if there are alternative plans that may be more suitable. The company could also evaluate the importance of lowering day charges for customers, and consider the impact on churn rates if such plans are not offered. Finally, they may want to improve on their customer service to decrease the likelihood of churn.

Through various research, it has emerged that churn in the telecom industry is most often due to bad customer service. Customers canceled their contracts for the following reasons:

companies wasted their time meaning it took forever to have their issues resolved.
they had to call more than once.
untrained or incompetent agents.
inferior self-service options.
It seems that being proactive is the key to effective churn management in telecom.
